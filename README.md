## Project Portfolio

### Insignio: Seeing Pneumothorax in X-Ray Images [1st June, 2019 - Present]
Demo available here: [https://kimia-insignio.tech](https://kimia-insignio.tech)

As a postdoctoral fellow responsible for Machine Learning Software Development in Kimia Lab for the Vector Institute Pathfinder project, I worked to apply and deploy deep learning in detecting Pneumothorax on chest X-ray images using Keras/Tensorflow, collaboratively with University Health Network in Toronto, achieving an accuracy of 89%. It is deployed as a web application hosted on Google Cloud with a self-registered domain name via Namecheap, leveraging Python Flask, HTML5, Javascript, with SSL encryption on data transmission.

### Spaceship Escape Online Game [4th Oct, 2019]
Demo available here: [https://antonioszeto.tech/static/space-app-2019/game.html](https://antonioszeto.tech/static/space-app-2019/game.html)

This is an online game, where the player needs to control the spaceship to escape from the surrounding space debris. The game was developed in [Space Apps Challenge 2019](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/). It is hosted on Google Cloud, developed using Python Flask, sqlite, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and PyGame. 

### Construction Materials Purchasing System [15th Sept, 2019]
Demo available here: [https://antonioszeto.tech](https://antonioszeto.tech)

This is a prototype system for helping users to purchase construction materials, developed in [Oxford Global Hackathon 2019 - Toronto](https://www.hackworks.com/en/OxfordHackathonToronto). The system is hosted on Google Cloud, developed using Python Flask, sqlite, HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. 

### Protein-Protein Interaction Site Machine Learning Prediction System [1st Oct, 2018 - 28th Feb, 2019]
Demo available here: [https://p2k.uwaterloo.ca](https://p2k.uwaterloo.ca)

This is a prototype system for predicting the interacting sites between two protein sequences, based on only sequence input. The machine learning models were constructed by Python scikit-learn, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a ROC of 15%. This piece of work has been published in [Nature Scientific reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32834-z). The system is developed using Python Flask, sqlite, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Bootstrap.
